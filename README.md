# Environmental Impact of Online Products

The focus of this project is to estimate the level of plastic content in Amazon products and analyze the carbon footprint of the products and at-scale-businesses selling on Amazon.
<br/>

Knowing that majority of the plastic thrown away in recycle bins ends up in landfill, over 78% customers (surveyed by GreenPrint) hope to find eco-friendly products however they have a difficult time identifying them. This project will help customers compare similar products based on their plastic content and the manufacturing brandâ€™s environmental impact.
